If you're using frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, some of them have a different setup. Some of them also have TypeScript have built-in so you don't have to do anything.

In this lesson, I will show you how to set up TypeScript in a simple JavaScript project.

## Prerequisites

To use TypeScript, you need the following tools installed on your device:

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en): runtime environment outside the browser
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/): which we'll use to install packages; you can use [any other package manager](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Package_management#a_rough_guide_to_package_manager_clients) also

## Initialize project

We'll be installing a couple of packages with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) so we're going to initialize our project, which comes with a `package.json` file:

```bash
npm init --yes
```

## Install TypeScript Dependencies

Install the `typescript` package:

```bash
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

The `--save-dev` flag is for TypeScript to be installed as a [development dependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/specifying-dependencies-and-devdependencies-in-a-package-json-file).

Install `ts-node`, which allows us to execute typescript code in NodeJS environment.

```bash
npm install -g ts-node
```

By default, NodeJS can only execute JavaScript code: `node index.js`, but with `ts-node`, we can run `ts-node index.ts`.

## Initialize TypeScript Configuration

You can configure TypeScript to compile your JavaScript in different ways. For this, you need to create a config file:

```bash
npx tsc --init
```

This would create `tsconfig.json` file in your project. We'll talk more about this file later.

## Create your first TypeScript file

TypeScript files end with the `ts` extension. Let's see an example of a TypeScript code:

<CodeBlock
  code={`let course: string = "typescript"
console.log(course)`}
  filename="index.ts"
  lang='ts'
/>

Don't worry so much about the syntax. But basically what we're saying here is, `course` should have a type of string, which means it can only hold string values.

Now, we can run this code:

```bash
ts-node index.ts
# "typescript"
```

We can also compile this code to JavaScript using:

```bash
npx tsc index.ts
```

This will compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript code based on the configurations provided in `tsconfig.json`

import JsTsEditor from "../../components/mdx/JsTsEditor.astro"

<JsTsEditor code1={`let course: string
  = "typescript"
console.log(course)`} code2={`let course
  = "typescript"
console.log(course)`} />

Now that we've been able to set up TypeScript, let's learn more about the TypeScript syntax.
