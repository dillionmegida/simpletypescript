You can create simple to advanced types with TypeScript. We've seen the `string` type, but let's learn about more basic types.

## number

<CodeBlock
  code={`let num1: number = 20
/**/num1/**/ = true
// ts-error **num1** Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'number'.`}
  lang='ts'
/>

## boolean

<CodeBlock
  code={`let isRaining: boolean = true
/**/isRaining/**/ = "false"
// ts-error **isRaining** Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.`}
  lang='ts'
/>

## arrays

We can declare an array of `string`s like this:

<CodeBlock
  code={`let fruits: string[] = ["mango", "orange", "strawberry"]
fruits.push(/**/20/**/)
// ts-error **20** Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.`}
  lang='ts'
/>

And an array of `number`s like this:

<CodeBlock
  code={`let numbers: number[] = [20, 40, 60]
numbers.push(/**/"hello"/**/)
// ts-error **"hello"** Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.`}
  lang='ts'
/>

There's also the `Array` type we can use like this:

<CodeBlock
  code={`let fruits: Array<string> = ["mango", "orange", "strawberry"]
fruits.push(/**/20/**/)
// ts-error **20** Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.`}
  lang='ts'
/>

Here we are using the `Array` generic type. Don't worry about this now. We'll learn about [generic types later](/course/type-generics).

## tuples

Tuples are like arrays but with a fixed number of elements which are also typed. Here's an example tuple:

<CodeBlock
  code={`let tuple: [string, number] = ["hello", 50]
tuple[/**/2/**/]
// ts-error **2** Tuple type '[string, number]' of length '2' has no element at index '2'.`}
  lang='ts'
/>

As you see above, trying to access an index not in the fixed length throws an error.

<CodeBlock
  code={`let tuple: [string, number] = ["hello", 50]
/**/tuple[0]/**/ = 20
// ts-error **tuple[0]** Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.`}
  lang='ts'
/>

From the above example, we assigned the `0` index to `string` so putting a `number` there throws an error.

## undefined

<CodeBlock
  code={`let user: undefined = undefined
/**/user/**/ = {
// ts-error **isRaining** Type '{ name: string; }' is not assignable to type 'undefined'.
  name: "deeecode"
}`}
  lang='ts'
/>

## object

You can also create an object type:

<CodeBlock
  code={`let user: {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isLoggedIn: boolean
} = {
  name: "deeecode",
  age: 40,
  isLoggedIn: true
}

user./**/something/**/ = "hello"
// ts-error **something** Property 'something' does not exist on type '{ name: string; age: number; isLoggedIn: boolean; }'`}
  lang='ts'
/>

Our type does not include a `something` field, so trying to add that field throws an error.

Looking at our object type, it's possible that we want one of the fields to be optional. Maybe we don't want the `age` field to be required. For that, we can use a question mark before the colon `?:`:

<CodeBlock
  code={`let user: {
  name: string;
  age?: number;
  isLoggedIn: boolean
} = {
  name: "deeecode",
  isLoggedIn: true
}`}
 lang='ts'
/>

Since `age` is optional, we do not need to pass it.
