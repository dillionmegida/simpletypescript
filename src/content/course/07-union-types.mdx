title: "Union Types"
description: "Sometimes, you want to do a this or that type. TypeScript allows you to do this with something called unions."

To create a union, you use the pipe `|` symbol:

```ts
let item: string | number
item = "deeecode"
item = 100
```

Here, `item` can have values of the `string` type or the `number` type. Any other type will result in an error:

<CodeBlock
  code={`let item: string | number
item = "deeecode"
item = 100
/**/item/**/ = true
// ts-error **item** Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string | number'.`}
  lang='ts'
/>

Or we can add the `boolean` to the union:

```ts
let item: string | number | boolean
item = "deeecode"
item = 100
item = true
```

Union Types can be useful when you want an array to contain multiple items:

<CodeBlock
  code={`let array: (string | number)[] = []

array.push("some string")
array.push(10, 40, 50)
array.push(/**/{}/**/)
// ts-error **{}** Argument of type '{}' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | number'`}
  lang='ts'
/>

Here, we type `array` to be an array of strings or numbers. Attempting to push `{}` as you see, throws an error.

Another example where unions can be useful is for a function's return type:

```ts
type User = {
  //
}

function getUser(id: string): null | User {
  // get user
}
```

`getUser` takeds an `id` of string, and tries to find that user (from storage somehow). In the case that it does, it returns the user object. In the case that it doesn't, it returns `null`.
