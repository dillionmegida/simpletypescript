The `keyof` and `typeof` keyword are very useful keywords that you can use for many interesting things. One of which is **creating types from the keys of an object**.

The `typeof` keyword exists in the JavaScript world as well as the TypeScript world and it does similar things: get the type of a value.

The `keyof` keyword creates a type out of the keys of an object type. Let's see examples:

<CodeBlock
  code={`type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: string;
  languages: string[]
}

let /**/key/**/: keyof Person
// ts-info **key** key: 'name' | 'age' | 'languages'`}
  lang="ts"
/>

In this example, `key` would be a union type of the properties (keys) in the `Person` Type:

<CodeBlock
  code={`type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: string;
  languages: string[]
}

let key: keyof Person

key = 'name' // fine

/**/key/**/ = 'something'
// ts-error **key** Type '"something"' is not assignable to type 'keyof Person'`}
  lang="ts"
/>

Let's say we had an object like this:

```js
const dutchTranslation = {
  "hello": "hoi",
  "good morning": "goedemorgen",
  "difficult": "moeilijk",
  "grandma": "oma"
}
```

The `dutchTranslation` object has key-value pairs where the key is the english word and the value is the dutch word. How can we create a key type from the keys in this object? You might think `keyof`:

<CodeBlock
  code={`const dutchTranslation = {
  "hello": "hoi",
  "good morning": "goedemorgen",
  "difficult": "moeilijk",
  "grandma": "oma"
}

type /**/TranslationKey/**/ = keyof dutchTranslation
// ts-error **dutchTranslation** 'dutchTranslation' refers to a value, but is being used as a type here.`}
  lang="ts"
/>

`keyof` does not work because it expects a type, not a value. In `keyof dutchTranslation`, `dutchTranslation` points to a value. So, what we have to do first is get the type of `dutchTranslation`. Here, we can use `typeof:

<CodeBlock
  code={`const dutchTranslation = {
  "hello": "hoi",
  "good morning": "goedemorgen",
  "difficult": "moeilijk",
  "grandma": "oma"
}

type DutchTranslationType = typeof dutchTranslation`}
  lang="ts"
/>

`DutchTranslationType` will look like this:

```ts
{
  "hello": string;
  "good morning": string;
  "difficult": string;
  "grandma": string;
}
```

Now that we have the type, we can use `keyof`:

<CodeBlock
  code={`const dutchTranslation = {
  "hello": "hoi",
  "good morning": "goedemorgen",
  "difficult": "moeilijk",
  "grandma": "oma"
}

type DutchTranslationType = typeof dutchTranslation
type /**/TranslationKey/**/ = keyof DutchTranslationType
// ts-info **TranslationKey** TranslationKey: 'hello' | 'good morning' | 'difficult' | 'grandma' `}
  lang="ts"
/>

`TranslationKey` holds a union type of the keys in the object. You can also combine `keyof` and `typeof` like this:

```ts
type TranslationKey = keyof typeof dutchTranslation
```
