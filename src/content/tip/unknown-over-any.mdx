<Info>
  With `any`, you turn off type check from TypeScript, which can be harmful.
  With `unknown`, your variables can still be of any type, but they are a safer
  way to build applications because you still get type checks.
</Info>

`any` is a generic type in TypeScript which can be "anything". It is often used to escape the type system instead of having to provide the exact types for different things:

```ts
let variable: any

variable.push() // TS says nothing
Object.values(variable) // TS says nothing
variable.startsWith() // TS says nothing
```

`any` is a placeholder for `array` so `.push()` could exist.

`any` is a placeholder for `object` so it can be passed as an argument to `Object.values`

`any` is a placeholder for `string` so `.startsWith` could exist.

The problem with this is that, **it is not safe**. TypeScript is supposed to help you identify type errors, but using `any` would turn off that support. If a variable is not an array, TypeScript should tell you `.push()` does not exist:

<CodeBlock
  code={`let variable: string = "hello"

// ts-error **push** Property 'push' does not exist on type 'string'
variable./**/push/**/(5, 6)`}
  lang="ts"
/>

But TypeScript won't say anything if you used `any`:

```ts
let variable: any = "hello"

variable.push(5, 6)
```

Sometimes you do not want to provide a type, or maybe a variable can be different types, so you just use `any`. However, there's something even better can use: `unknown`.

<Info type="large">`unknown` is like the **safer version** of `any`.</Info>

So what difference does `unknown` make?

With `unknown`, you are saying "this can be any type but I don't know what that type is yet". The beauty of this is that, before you use that variable for certain operations, you have to first "check" if that operation is possible.

Let's look at the string example from earlier:

```ts
let variable: any = [1, 2]

variable.startsWith() // TS says nothing

// but this will throw an error during runtime
// because startsWith does not exist on a string
```

Here, `variable` is of `any`. But it actually holds an array, and arrays do not have a `startsWith` method. But TypeScript does not say anything. But let's try `unknown`:

<CodeBlock
  code={`let variable: unknown = [1, 2]

// ts-error **variable** 'variable' is of type 'unknown'
/**/variable/**/.startsWith()`}
  lang="ts"
/>

What you see here is TypeScript complaining. TypeScript is like "well, you just told me that you do 'not know' the type for this variable, so I cannot guarantee you that this variable has the `startsWith` method".

So what if you wanted to use the `startsWith` method? Then you have to "tell" TypeScript that this is a string. How? **Type Guards**:
o
```ts
let variable: unknown = [1, 2]

if (typeof variable === "string") {
  variable.startsWith() // TS says "we good"
}
```

By checking if `variable` is a string, then you give TypeScript the guarantee that you are working with a string, and so it approves the `startsWith` method.

This is why I say that `unknown` is a safer type than `any`. With `any`, you do not have to provide such checks. You could choose to do it, but you aren't required to do to get TypeScript to stop yelling at you. But with `unknown`, you have to, to get a pass.

Type guards can exist in different ways. For example, you can use `Array.isArray()` to check if a value is of an array type:

```ts
let variable: unknown = [1, 2]

if (typeof variable === "string") {
  variable.startsWith() // TS says "we good"
}

if (Array.isArray(variable)) {
  variable.push(3, 4) // TS says "we good"
}
```

{/* show example with instance */}

See how safe our applications are with type support?

So when you're not sure what type to give a variable, instead of using `any`, go for `unknown`. While both types can mean "any type", `unknown` ensures that you do type checks before proceeding to carrying out certain operations.
